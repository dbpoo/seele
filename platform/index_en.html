                As a community governance model with the characteristics of blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) has many advantages such as decentralization, high efficiency, and clear rights and interests. For industrial projects and applications, the introduction of decentralized autonomous model has largely solved various problems caused by the defects of too many confirmation levels and unclear rights and interests of all parties in the traditional governance model. Therefore, SeeleN Industrial Asset Value Exchange Platform will introduce the decentralized autonomous model to form an "industrial self-governance ecology" on the platform.

                SeeleN Industrial Asset Value Exchange Platform pioneered the use of "dual pass" model that paralleled "functional token" and "governance token". In addition to the functions of value circulation and gas consumption, “functional tokens” are provided by “super nodes” for network contributions such as block generation and verification in the POS mode, and “functional tokens” are also used to reward super users who have made contributions. "governance token" is the core manifestation of the voting rights and right to earnings of all participants of the platform, including super node selection, earnings distribution, project selection and parameter formulation and other platform governance-related rights, which will be fully exercised by “governance token".
